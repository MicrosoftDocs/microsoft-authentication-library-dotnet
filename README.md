# Microsoft Authentication Library for .NET

This is the documentation repository for Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for .NET. If you are looking for the library, refer to [AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet).

## Contributions

Contributions to our documentation are welcome. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/style-guide/welcome/) and the [Contributor Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/contribute/) before making any changes.

> **Warning**
> **Do not** modify any XML files in the `dotnet/xml` folder - those are generated automatically from the library source code and any changes will be automatically overwritten the next time the documentation Continuous Integration (CI) job runs. To make changes to any API docs you will need to open a pull request in the [AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet) repository.

If you would like to author an entirely new document (e.g., for a new scenario), make sure to [open an issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-authentication-library-dotnet/issues) first. This will allow the engineering team to discuss the proposed changes and ensure that it won't be overwritten by future changes.
