# Creating configuration for Intune Mobile App Management conditional access

## Scenario

There is a scenario when a user of a client application wants to access resources protected by specific permissions (i.e., scopes) in a backend application. The resource is accessible only when certain app protection policies and access conditions are met. In such situation, an access token is issued only when the conditions are met.  

This scenario includes a backend application, and an iOS and Android client applications. The setup for the two platforms is slightly different. This article describes the steps to correctly configure these applications for the above scenario to work. At the same time, the article avoids going into granular details.

## Setup application

### Setup User and Group for testing

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).
2. Create a test user (e.g. `XamTestuser@XamTester.onmicrosoft.com`).
3. On the user profile page, go to **Licenses**.
4. Click on **Assignments** and select the following:
    - Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 License
    - Enterprise Mobility + Security
    - Intune
    - Microsoft 365 Business standard

    >[!NOTE]
    >These policies do not apply to guest users.
5. Create a test group (e.g. `MAM_Test_Users`).

    >[!NOTE]
    >Remember the name of the group. This will need to be assigned at later stages.

6. Add the new user to this group.

### Setup Enterprise App and Conditional Access policy

Register a backend application:

1. In [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview), go to Enterprise Applications section.
2. Click on **New application**.
3. Click **Create your own application**.
4. Select **Register an application to integrate with Microsoft Entra ID (App you're developing)** option.
5. After **Create** screen, it will take you to **Register An Application** screen.
6. Select **Multitenant** and click **Register**.
7. This will take you to the screen in #1.

Enable conditional access:

1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications**.
2. Select the application that you created.
3. Assign the user group that was created earlier.
4. Click on **Conditional Access**.
5. Click **New policy** and select:
    - In **Users or workload identities**, select the group that was created earlier.
    - In **Cloud Apps or actions**, verify that this has the enterprise application that was created.
    - In **Conditions**, select multiple options:
        - **Device Platforms** - select **Yes** and choose **iOS + Android**.
        - **Client Apps** - select **Yes** and select all the options.

5. It will generate a Guid and **Application ID Uri** and ask you to create a scope.
6. Note the URI of the scope. This is needed in the client application.
7. Click on **API Permissions** section.
8. Click on **Add a permission**.
9. Select the permission created in the earlier stage and click **Add Permission**.
