# Known issues with MSAL.NET

MSAL throws a few types of exceptions, please see [Exceptions](../advanced/exceptions/index.md).

## Confidential Client

Please read the guide on [High Availability](../advanced/high-availability.md).

## Public Client

### Device Compliance failures on Windows 10

Users are unable to login interactively and a "Device is not compliant" error is shown when:

* The tenant admin has enabled the "Require device to be marked as compliant" Conditional Access policy
* The app is invoking public client flows (i.e. rich client apps, not web sites)
* The app is using the embedded browser control available in ADAL or MSAL (this is the default for .NET Framework apps)

#### Mitigation

* The recommended approach is to use [WAM](../acquiring-tokens/desktop-mobile/wam.md).
* Otherwise, you can also configure MSAL to use the system (default OS) browser (details in [Using web browsers (MSAL.NET)](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-net-web-browsers#how-to-use-the-default-os-browser)). Both Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers are able to satisfy the device policy.
* If using ADAL, migrate to MSAL first. There is no mitigation for ADAL use.

### Android

On Android, an `AndroidActivityNotFound` exception is thrown when the device does not have a browser with tabs. See [Xamarin Android system browser considerations for using MSAL.NET](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-net-system-browser-android-considerations#known-issues)

### iOS

Please see [Xamarin iOS Considerations](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-net-xamarin-ios-considerations#known-issues-with-ios-12-and-authentication).

### UWP

The recommended approach is to use [WAM](../acquiring-tokens/desktop-mobile/wam.md).

Most issues on UWP occur due to network problems, such as proxies that block the traffic etc. Integrated Windows Auth may also be blocked by admins. For more details see [Considerations for using Universal Windows Platform with MSAL.NET](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-net-uwp-considerations#troubleshooting).

### Desktop

On a Desktop app, a `StateMismatchError` exception is thrown when the using a long Facebook ID (via B2C) in conjunction with the embedded browser.
For more details, please [refer to our documentation](../advanced/exceptions/understanding-statemismatcherror.md).

## Build issues

Behavior: an error similar to `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Contracts.targets(4,5): error : Must use PackageReference` is thrown

Starting with version 4.23, MSAL references `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Contracts`. NuGet can only resolve this reference if the application consuming MSAL references it as `<PackageReference>` and not via the legacy `packages.config` mechanism. See #2247 for details on how to fix this.
