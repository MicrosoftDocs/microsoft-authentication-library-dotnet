>[!WARNING]
>Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) **has been deprecated**. While existing apps that use ADAL will continue to work, Microsoft will no longer release security fixes on ADAL. Use the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](/entra/msal/) to avoid putting your app's security at risk.
