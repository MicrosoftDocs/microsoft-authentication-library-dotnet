## Importance of logging with MSAL

Among its many capabilities, Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) has robust built-in [logging features](../advanced/exceptions/msal-logging.md). Enabling logging in your applications ensures that you have a direct line of sight on any authentication issues and can both diagnose them easier for your own application and help the MSAL team quickly address potential problems. We strongly recommend that you enable logging for your applications when deployed in any production scenarios.
