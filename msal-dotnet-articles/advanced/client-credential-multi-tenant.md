# Using MSAL.NET for client credential flow in multi-tenant services

## Decision point - Microsoft.Identity.Web or Microsoft.Identity.Client (MSAL)?

If you use ASP.NET Core, you are encouraged to adopt [`Microsoft.Identity.Web`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/wiki), which provides a higher level API over token acquisition and has better defaults. See [Is MSAL.NET right for me?](../getting-started/choosing-msal-dotnet.md)

## Decision point - token caching

MSAL maintains a token cache which grows with each token acquired. MSAL manages token lifetimes in a smart way, so you should use its cache. You have the option of using in-memory caching or distributed caching. 

See [MSAL.NET Token Cache Serialization](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-net-token-cache-serialization).

We recommend using persisted distributed caches (e.g. Redis, Cosmos etc.) for all user flows.

We also recommend that multi-tenant service 2 service apps use persisted distributed caches. But you may get away with using a memory cache with evictions if you know that your service needs app tokens for a limited number of tenants.
