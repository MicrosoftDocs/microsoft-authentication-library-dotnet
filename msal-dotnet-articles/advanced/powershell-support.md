# Using MSAL.NET from PowerShell

There is no official PowerShell module or wrapper for MSAL libraries maintained by the SDK team - our team recommends using a supported SDK.

Consider using higher level APIs which are officially supported: 

 -  [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](/powershell/microsoftgraph/get-started)
 -  [Azure PowerShell SDK](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az)

PowerShell was designed to be able to call into .NET code and there are [numerous resources](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3079346/how-to-reference-net-assemblies-using-powershell) that describe how to do this.
