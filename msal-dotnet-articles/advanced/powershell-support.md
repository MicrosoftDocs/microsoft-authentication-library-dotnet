# Using MSAL.NET with PowerShell

There is **no official PowerShell module or wrapper** for MSAL libraries maintained by the Entra SDK team. Consider using maintained higher level SDKs:

- [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation)
- [Azure PowerShell SDK](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az)

PowerShell was designed to be able to call into .NET code and there are [additional resources](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3079346/how-to-reference-net-assemblies-using-powershell) that describe how to do this.
