# Errors associated with Web Account Manager (WAM)

Generally, errors generated by the MSAL component that interacts with the Web Account Manager (WAM) are [automatically converted](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/d25f45f7e356bd92986e412dd68b5d341343aa6a/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/Platforms/Features/RuntimeBroker/WamAdapters.cs#L56) to an instance of <xref:Microsoft.Identity.Client.MsalException>. This enables developers to not worry about the internals and instead handle errors through idiomatic .NET constructs. However, for additional deep dives, developers will often need to investigate specific error messages.

The table below highlights some of the most common errors along with potential mititgation strategies. For other exceptions, refer to the [Exceptions document](../../advanced/exceptions/index.md).

>[!WARNING]
>Error codes and error messages are presented for reference only. We do not recommend manually implementing exception handling strategies based on these and instead use the standard <xref:Microsoft.Identity.Client.MsalException>-based approach.

| Error Code | Error message | Mitigation |
|:-----------|:--------------|:-----------|
| 2147943631 | The network location cannot be reached. For information about network troubleshooting, see Windows Help. | Potentially an intermittent error. Try running the code later, and ensure that the computer has active Internet access. |

| 3399548929 | Need user interaction to continue. | When authenticating the user, WAM could not use a cached token. User needs to be prompted for authentication via <xref:Microsoft.Identity.Client.PublicClientApplication.AcquireTokenInteractive*>. |
| 3399614467 | V2Error: invalid_grant AADSTS500341: The user account {ID} has been deleted from the {TENANT_ID} directory. To sign into this application, the account must be added to the directory.| Ensure that the account with which the user tries to sign in is registered in Microsoft Entra ID. |
| 3399614476 | V2Error: invalid_grant AADSTS50078: Presented multi-factor authentication has expired due to policies configured by your administrator, you must refresh your multi-factor authentication to access {API_TARGET}. | Account needs to be configured by the Microsoft Entra ID administrator with up-to-date MFA settings. |

## Unlisted errors

Because WAM is a new component, when errors occur we recommend logging data from [`AdditionalExceptionData`](xref:Microsoft.Identity.Client.MsalException.AdditionalExceptionData*) and [logging a bug](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues). We will document the issue as soon as possible.
