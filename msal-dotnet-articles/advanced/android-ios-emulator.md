# Using MSAL.NET with Android and iOS emulators

>[!NOTE]
>The MSAL .NET team recommends testing with an Android or iOS device whenever possible, as there are subtle differences between authentication with an emulator and a device.

Some of those issues are documented here in the [native Android MSAL library Wiki](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-android/wiki/Android-Emulator-with-MSAL).

For iOS, there are differences between SSO and accessing keychain when using an emulator or a device. Before opening an issue or reporting a bug, please see if the issue replicates on a device.
